## Overview

Mind maps visualize hierarchical information radiating from a central concept. Each branch represents a subtopic, with deeper nesting for finer detail. Mind maps are useful for brainstorming, project planning, knowledge organization, and breaking down complex topics.

**Interactive features:** Click nodes to navigate to their source line. Collapse and expand subtrees by clicking nodes with children. Toggle tag group coloring and depth-based coloring via the legend controls.

## Syntax

```
mindmap Title

Node
  Child Node
    Grandchild
  Another Child
```

The first line declares the chart type. The title becomes the root node. Indentation establishes the parent-child hierarchy.

## Nodes

Every non-blank, non-directive line is a node. Nesting is set by indentation:

```
mindmap Root
  Level 1a
    Level 2a
    Level 2b
  Level 1b
```

### Node Colors

Append a color name (lowercase) at the end of the label:

```
Important Topic red
  Sub-topic blue
```

### Descriptions

Nodes can have descriptions shown as secondary text. Two forms:

```
// Same-line form
Surveys description: Quarterly NPS survey

// Indented form (before children)
Auth System
  description: Handle login, signup, and OAuth flows
  Login Page
```

### Collapse Default

Set a node's default collapsed state with metadata:

```
Nice-to-haves collapsed: true
  Dark Mode
  Export PDF
```

Collapsed nodes show a drill-bar indicating hidden children. Click to expand.

## Multi-Root

Omit the title to create multiple independent root trees:

```
mindmap

Q1 Goals
  Ship MVP
  Hire designers
Q2 Goals
  Launch marketing
  Expand team
```

The diagram title is inferred from the first root's label.

## Tag Groups

Tag groups define color-coded categories. They appear before content and follow the standard tag syntax:

```
mindmap Root

tag Priority as p
  High red
  Medium yellow
  Low green

  Task A p: High
  Task B p: Low
```

- The alias (`p`) provides a shorthand for metadata keys
- The active tag group colors nodes by their tag value
- Click a tag group name in the legend to activate or deactivate it

## Options

| Option | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `active-tag GroupName` | Set the default active tag group |
| `no-descriptions` | Hide description text on all nodes |

Options are placed on their own line before content:

```
mindmap Root

tag Priority as p
  High red
  Low green

active-tag Priority
no-descriptions

  Task A p: High
```
