## Overview

State diagrams model states and transitions. Write states as plain text and connect them with `->` arrows. Diagrammo handles the layout automatically. Use `[*]` for start/end pseudostates and indent lines to chain transitions from a parent state.

## Syntax

```
state Diagram Title
direction-tb

[*] -> Idle
Idle -event-> Active
Active -> [*]
```

## Settings

| Key            | Description                                     | Default |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `chart`        | Must be `state`                                 | —       |
| `title`        | Diagram title                                   | None    |
| `direction-tb` | Top-to-bottom layout (default is left-to-right) | `TB`    |

## States

Write state names as plain text. States are created automatically when referenced:

```
Idle -> Active -> Done
```

### Pseudostates

Use `[*]` for start and end points. They render as filled circles:

```
[*] -> Idle
Done -> [*]
```

## Transitions

Connect states with `->`. Add labels between dashes:

```
Idle -> Active
Idle -start-> Active
Active -finish-> Done
```

### Indent-Based Source Inference

Indent transitions under a state heading to chain them from that state:

```
Idle
  -start-> Active
  -reset-> Stopped
Active
  -> Done
```

This is equivalent to writing `Idle -start-> Active`, `Idle -reset-> Stopped`, and `Active -> Done`.

### Transition Chains

Chain multiple states on a single line:

```
[*] -> Idle -> Active -> Done -> [*]
```

## State Colors

Append a color name (lowercase) at the end of a state label:

```
Active green -> Error red
```

The 11 recognized colors are: `red`, `orange`, `yellow`, `green`, `blue`, `purple`, `teal`, `cyan`, `gray`, `black`, `white`. To use one as a literal label, capitalize it.

## Groups

Use bracket syntax `[Name]` to visually group states into regions. States indented under the bracket line belong to the group. The group closes when indentation returns to the bracket's level or below:

```
state

[Happy Path] green
  [*] -> Processing -> Approved -> [*]

[Error Handling] red
  Processing -fail-> Rejected -> [*]
```

Groups render as labeled background boxes with optional colors.

## Comments

```
// This line is ignored by the parser
[*] -> Idle
```
