```
Jan 3 5 2
Feb 4 3 4
```

The number of values per line must match the number of series names.

## Era Bands

Annotate named time periods with a shaded background band and label:

```dgmo

era Jan -> Mar Q1 green
era Apr -> Jun Q2 orange

Jan 3 5
Feb 4 3

May 5 6
Jun 3 8
```

Era syntax: `era <start> -> <end> Label color`

- `start` and `end` must exactly match data point labels
- Color is optional; omit for the palette default
- Era bands render on the first series only

```
series Gold yellow, Silver gray, Bronze orange

```
