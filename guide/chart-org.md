## Overview

Org charts use **indentation** to define reporting hierarchy. Each person is a line of text, and metadata like `role:` appears indented beneath them. Children are indented under their manager.

## Syntax

```
org Chart Title

Person Name
  role: Job Title

  Direct Report
    role: Job Title
```

## Settings

| Key     | Description   | Default |
| ------- | ------------- | ------- |
| `chart` | Must be `org` | Yes     |
| `title` | Chart title   | None    |

## Nodes

Each non-indented (or less-indented) text line creates a person node. Deeper indentation creates a child (direct report):

```
CEO
  VP of Engineering
    Senior Engineer
    Junior Engineer
  VP of Sales
    Account Executive
```

## Metadata

Add key-value pairs indented under a node:

```
Alice Park
  role: Senior Engineer
  location: New York
  focus: APIs
```

Metadata renders as secondary text on the node card.

### Compact Pipe Syntax

For concise entries, use `|` to put metadata on a single line:

```
Alice Park | role: Senior Engineer | location: NY
Bob Torres | role: Junior Engineer | location: CO
```

## Containers (Teams)

Use `[Team Name]` to create a container that groups its children visually:

```
Alex Chen
  role: CTO

  [Platform Team]
    goal: Core infrastructure and APIs

    Alice Park | role: Senior Engineer
    Bob Torres | role: Junior Engineer

  [Frontend Team]
    goal: Ship new design system by Q3

    Carol Wu | role: Senior Engineer
    Dave Kim | role: Junior Engineer
```

Containers render as labeled boxes. They can have metadata like `goal:` and `charter:` which display below the container label.

## Node Colors

Add a color name in parentheses:

```
[Platform Team blue]
[Frontend Team green]
```

## Tag Groups

Define color-coded tags for metadata values like location or status. Tag groups must appear before org content:

```
org Acme Corp

tag Location
  NY blue
  LA yellow
  Remote purple

tag Status
  FTE green
  Contractor orange

Jane Smith
  role: CEO
  location: NY
  status: FTE
```

- `tag GroupName` starts a tag group
- `as <alias>` provides a shorthand for metadata keys (e.g., `tag Location as l`)
- `default` marks the fallback value for nodes without that metadata
- When a node's metadata value matches a tag entry, it renders with that tag's color as a badge

## Comments

```
// This line is ignored by the parser
```

## Collapse / Expand

In the app, click a node that has children to focus it. Click again to collapse its subtree — a "+N hidden" label shows how many nodes are hidden. Click once more to expand. Containers can be collapsed independently.

Keyboard: Tab to focus a node, Enter or Space to toggle.
