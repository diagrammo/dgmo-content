## Overview

Kanban boards visualize work items as cards organized into columns. Columns typically represent workflow stages (To Do, In Progress, Done). Cards can carry tags for color-coded categorization and freeform detail text.

**Drag-and-drop:** In the app, drag cards between columns or reorder within a column. The editor text updates automatically.

## Syntax

```
kanban Board Title

[Column Name]
Card Title
Card Title key: Value, key: Value
  Freeform detail text
  Another detail line
```

## Settings

| Key     | Description      | Default |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| `chart` | Must be `kanban` | —       |
| `title` | Board title      | None    |

## Columns

Columns are defined with `[Column Name]` syntax. All cards between one column header and the next belong to that column.

Kanban columns model a workflow pipeline. Cards move left to right as work progresses. Each column should answer "what stage is this work in?" If something isn't a stage — like acceptance criteria, decision gates, or definitions of done — model it as a tag on cards rather than a separate column.

```
[To Do]
[In Progress]
[Done]
```

### WIP Limits

Add `wip: N` after a column header to set a work-in-progress limit. A warning appears when the limit is exceeded:

```
[In Progress] wip: 3
```

## Cards

Each non-indented line within a column creates a card. Cards can have tags and detail lines.

### Tags

Tags follow the card title. Multiple tags are comma-separated:

```
Build login priority: High, assignee: Alice
```

### Detail Lines

Indented lines under a card are freeform detail text:

```
Build login priority: High
  OAuth + email/password support
  Needs design review first
```

### Card Colors

Append a color name (lowercase) to a card title:

```
Urgent fix red
```

## Tag Groups

Tag groups define categories with color-coded values. They appear before columns and use the `tag` directive:

```
tag Priority
  High red
  Medium yellow
  Low green default

tag Assignee as a
  Alice blue
  Bob purple
```

- `default` marks the fallback value for cards without an explicit tag
- `alias` provides a short name for the tag (e.g., `a` instead of `assignee`)
- Colors are shown as dots on each card

## Swimlanes

Slice the board into horizontal swimlanes by a tag group with `lane-by GroupName`. Each tag value gets its own lane, so cards split into rows (by owner, team, priority) while keeping their columns:

```
kanban Sprint Board
lane-by Team

tag Team as t
  Frontend blue
  Backend purple

[To Do]
Login page t: Frontend
Rate limiting t: Backend

[Done]
Landing page t: Frontend
```

It's named `lane-by` rather than `swimlane` because `swimlane` is its own chart type. This directive is persisted from the app's swimlane picker, so it lives in the source and every renderer honors it.
