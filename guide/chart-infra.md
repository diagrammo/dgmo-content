## Overview

Infrastructure diagrams model system topology as a **directed traffic flow graph**. You declare components, wire them together, and set behavioral properties — DGMO computes downstream RPS, latency percentiles, availability, circuit breaker states, and queue metrics automatically.

Unlike static architecture diagrams, infra diagrams are **live simulations**. Change the entry RPS or switch a scenario and every downstream metric updates.

Components don't have explicit types — their **role is inferred from their properties**. A node with `cache-hit` is a cache. One with `buffer` is a queue. One with `concurrency` is serverless.

## Settings

| Key                   | Description                                                          | Default  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `chart`               | Must be `infra`                                                      | —        |
| `title`               | Diagram title                                                        | None     |

| `slo-warning-margin`  | Margin below the SLO that triggers a warning state                   | `0.005`  |
| `active-tag`          | Tag dimension to color by (first declared is active by default; `none` suppresses) | first group |
| `animate`             | Flow animation (boolean; `no-animate` to disable)                    | on       |

The universal `fill-solid` and `no-title` options also apply.

## Entry Point (Edge)

Every diagram needs exactly one **edge entry point** — the source of all inbound traffic. Name a component `Edge` (or `Internet`) and give it an `rps` property:

```
Edge
  rps: 100000
  -> FirstComponent
```

The `rps` property is **only valid on the edge node**. All downstream RPS values are computed from this single number.

## Components

A component is any named node — server, database, cache, queue, or service. Write the name on its own line, then indent properties below it:

```
APIServer
  description: Handles REST API requests for the mobile app
  max-rps: 500
  latency-ms: 30
  uptime: 99.95%
```

Names must start with a letter or underscore and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.

### Quoted names

To use a label that contains spaces or reserved characters (`|`, `:`, `(`), wrap it in double quotes:

```
"Order Service"
  max-rps: 500

"Payments | Stripe"
  max-rps: 200
```

### Aliases

Bind a short alias with `as` and reference it from edges or group targets:

```
"Customer Orders DB" as ordersdb
  max-rps: 6000
  latency-ms: 8

APIServer
  -> ordersdb
```

Aliases must start with a letter or underscore and be at most 12 characters. They are scoped to the document.

## Connections

Connect components with arrow syntax:

```
-> Target                           // unlabeled sync
-/api-> Target                      // labeled sync
-/api-> Target split: 60%           // with traffic split
-> [Group Name]                     // to a group
-> alias                            // to an aliased node
~> Target                           // unlabeled async
~event~> Target                     // labeled async
-> Target fanout: 5                 // request amplification
```

Connections define the directed acyclic graph (DAG) that traffic flows through. **Cycles are not allowed** — DGMO will report an error.

### Sync vs. async

Sync arrows (`->`) represent request/response traffic — the caller is waiting and downstream latency contributes to the caller's response time.

Async arrows (`~>`) represent fire-and-forget messaging — events published to a bus, work enqueued for a worker, webhook deliveries. Async edges render with a wiggle pattern and **do not contribute to the caller's cumulative latency**. Use them for:

- Pub/sub event publishing
- Background job dispatch (before the queue node)
- Webhook fan-out
- Audit/log streams

```
Checkout
  -> OrderDB                        // sync write
  ~OrderPlaced~> EventBus           // async event
```

## Traffic Splits

When a component has multiple outbound connections, traffic is distributed across them. Add `split: N%` after the target to declare an explicit percentage.

### All splits declared

When every outbound edge has a split, they **must sum to 100%**. DGMO warns if they don't.

```
LB
  -/api-> API split: 60%
  -/web-> Web split: 30%
  -/static-> Static split: 10%
```

If the LB receives 10,000 RPS after upstream behaviors: API gets 6,000, Web gets 3,000, Static gets 1,000.

### No splits declared

When no outbound edge has a split, traffic is distributed **evenly**:

```
LB
  -> API
  -> Web
  -> Static
```

Three targets → each gets 33.3% of the LB's output RPS.

### Some splits declared

When only some edges have splits, the declared percentages are used and undeclared targets **share the remainder equally**:

```
LB
  -/api-> API split: 60%
  -/web-> Web split: 20%
  -/health-> Health
  -/metrics-> Metrics
```

API gets 60%, Web gets 20%, and the remaining 20% is split evenly between Health (10%) and Metrics (10%).

If the declared splits exceed 100%, DGMO produces a warning.

### Splits happen after behaviors

Split percentages apply to the **post-behavior** RPS — after cache, firewall, and rate-limit reductions. If a component receives 10,000 RPS and has `cache-hit: 50%`, only 5,000 RPS reach the split point:

```
CDN
  cache-hit: 50%
  -/api-> API split: 70%      // 3,500 RPS
  -/static-> Static split: 30%  // 1,500 RPS
```

### Single outbound connection

A component with one outbound edge always sends 100% of its (post-behavior) traffic — no split annotation needed:

```
CDN
  cache-hit: 80%
  -> API
```

---

## Fanout

Splits divide traffic. **Fanout multiplies it.** Use `fanout: N` when a single inbound request produces N outbound requests downstream — scatter-gather queries, search shard fanout, pub/sub broadcast, retry duplication.

```
SearchAPI
  -> SearchShards fanout: 6
```

If SearchAPI receives 1,000 RPS, SearchShards will receive `1,000 × 6 = 6,000` RPS. Each user search produces 6 shard queries.

### Formula

```
target_rps = source_post_behavior_rps × fanout
```

Fanout is applied to the **post-behavior** RPS at the source (after cache, firewall, and rate-limit reductions), just like splits.

### Combining with split

Splits and fanout compose. The split is applied first; then each split branch multiplies by its `fanout`:

```
EventBus
  -> EmailService split: 50%, fanout: 2
  -> SmsService   split: 50%
```

If EventBus emits 1,000 events/s:

- 500 RPS → EmailService, then **×2 fanout** → EmailService receives **1,000 RPS** (one event → one email per subscriber × 2 subscribers)
- 500 RPS → SmsService

### Fan-Out badge

Any source with at least one outgoing fanout edge (where `N > 1`) automatically gains a **Fan-Out** capability badge — it appears in the legend and on the node card, just like Cache, Firewall, or Queue. This makes amplification points visible at a glance.

### Rules

- `N` must be ≥ 1. Values below 1 are warned and clamped to 1 (use a split percentage to express attenuation).
- Fanout works on both sync (`->`) and async (`~>`) edges.
- The legacy `xN` suffix (e.g. `-> Shards x5`) has been removed — use `fanout: 5` instead.

---

## Component Properties

Each property maps to a specific behavior in the traffic simulation. The sections below are grouped by capability.

### Capability badges

Diagrammo infers a component's **role** from its properties and surfaces it as a colored badge on the node card and in the legend. There are no `type:` declarations — the properties speak for themselves.

| Badge            | Color   | Triggered by                                          |
| ---------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Cache            | Green   | `cache-hit`                                           |
| Firewall         | Red     | `firewall-block`                                      |
| Rate Limiter     | Yellow  | `ratelimit-rps`                                       |
| Service          | Blue    | `max-rps`                                             |
| Circuit Breaker  | Purple  | `cb-error-threshold` or `cb-latency-threshold-ms`     |
| Serverless       | Cyan    | `concurrency`                                         |
| Queue            | Purple  | `buffer`                                              |
| Fan-Out          | Orange  | ≥ 1 outgoing edge with `fanout > 1`                   |

A node can carry multiple badges (e.g. a cache that is also a rate limiter). The badge legend is computed from the diagram — nothing to declare.

### Description — `description`

Add a short prose annotation to any non-edge component. The description is **display metadata only** — it has no effect on traffic simulation.

```
AuthService
  description: Handles JWT issuance and session validation
  max-rps: 2000
  latency-ms: 15
```

The description appears as a muted subtitle below the component name **only when the component is selected** (clicked). This keeps the diagram clean at rest while surfacing context on demand.

- Single line — no wrapping
- Colon-separated value: `description: Handles auth — JWT, sessions`
- Silently ignored on the `Edge`/`Internet` entry-point node

### Cache — `cache-hit`

A cache layer absorbs traffic before it reaches downstream. The percentage is the fraction served from cache.

```
CDN
  cache-hit: 80%
  -> AppServer
```

**Effect on downstream RPS:**

```
downstream_rps = inbound_rps × (1 − cache_hit / 100)
```

100K RPS with `cache-hit: 80%` → only 20K forwarded downstream.

### Firewall — `firewall-block`

Drops a percentage of inbound traffic (malicious requests, bots, blocked IPs):

```
WAF
  firewall-block: 5%
  -> Gateway
```

**Effect:** `downstream_rps = inbound_rps × (1 − firewall_block / 100)`

Cache and firewall compose multiplicatively. Traffic through `cache-hit: 80%` then `firewall-block: 5%` keeps only `20% × 95% = 19%`.

### Rate Limiting — `ratelimit-rps`

Caps throughput at a fixed threshold. Excess traffic is rejected:

```
Gateway
  ratelimit-rps: 10000
  -> API
```

**Effect:** `downstream_rps = min(effective_inbound_rps, ratelimit_rps)`

The effective inbound RPS is calculated after cache and firewall reductions. Rate limiting also reduces [availability](#how-availability-is-computed) — rejected traffic counts against it.

### Capacity — `max-rps` and `instances`

Define a component's throughput capacity. `max-rps` is per-instance, `instances` multiplies it:

```
API
  instances: 3
  max-rps: 400
  latency-ms: 30
```

**Total capacity:** `max_rps × instances = 400 × 3 = 1,200 RPS`

When computed RPS exceeds capacity, the component is **overloaded** — shown with red indicators.

If `instances` is omitted it defaults to 1. If `max-rps` is omitted the component has unlimited capacity.

### Dynamic Scaling — `instances: min-max`

A range like `instances: 1-8` makes DGMO compute the needed instance count:

```
API
  instances: 1-8
  max-rps: 300
  latency-ms: 25
```

**Formula:**

```
needed = ceil(computed_rps / max_rps)
actual  = clamp(needed, min, max)
```

If the API receives 2,000 RPS: `needed = ceil(2000/300) = 7`, `actual = clamp(7, 1, 8) = 7`. But at 5,000 RPS: `needed = 17`, `actual = 8` (maxed out, overloaded).

### Latency — `latency-ms`

Per-component response time in milliseconds. Latency accumulates along the path:

```
CDN
  latency-ms: 5
  -> API

API
  latency-ms: 40
  -> DB

DB
  latency-ms: 8
```

A request traversing CDN → API → DB has cumulative latency of `5 + 40 + 8 = 53ms`.

If omitted, a component contributes 0ms (or `default-latency-ms` if set).

### Uptime — `uptime`

Component reliability as a percentage. Uptime propagates as the **product** along paths:

```
API
  uptime: 99.95%
  -> DB

DB
  uptime: 99.99%
```

End-to-end: `99.95% × 99.99% ≈ 99.94%`

Defaults to 100% (or `default-uptime` if set globally).

### Circuit Breakers — `cb-error-threshold` and `cb-latency-threshold-ms`

Circuit breakers trip when failure conditions are met. DGMO models **closed** (normal) and **open** (tripped) states.

```
API
  max-rps: 300
  instances: 2
  cb-error-threshold: 50%
```

**Error-rate trigger:**

```
capacity   = max_rps × instances
error_rate = (computed_rps − capacity) / computed_rps × 100
if error_rate ≥ cb_error_threshold → OPEN
```

The error rate comes from overload — excess RPS beyond capacity is treated as errors.

**Latency trigger:**

```
if cumulative_latency_ms > cb_latency_threshold_ms → OPEN
```

Both triggers can be combined. The breaker opens if **either** fires.

### Serverless — `concurrency`, `duration-ms`, `cold-start-ms`

Serverless functions use a different capacity model based on concurrency and execution time:

```
ProcessOrder
  concurrency: 1000
  duration-ms: 200
  cold-start-ms: 800
```

**Capacity:** `concurrency / (duration_ms / 1000) = 1000 / 0.2 = 5,000 RPS`

**Cold starts:** DGMO splits traffic into two paths for percentile computation:

- 95% warm → latency = `duration-ms`
- 5% cold → latency = `duration-ms + cold-start-ms`

This means cold starts primarily affect p99 latency: a function with `duration-ms: 200` and `cold-start-ms: 800` shows p50 ≈ 200ms but p99 ≈ 1,000ms.

> **Mutual exclusion:** `concurrency` cannot be combined with `instances` or `max-rps`. A component is either serverless or traditional.

### Queues — `buffer`, `drain-rate`, `retention-hours`, `partitions`

Queues decouple producers from consumers. They absorb traffic bursts and **reset the latency boundary**.

```
OrderQueue
  buffer: 50000
  drain-rate: 1000
  retention-hours: 72
  -> Worker
```

| Property          | What it does                                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `buffer`          | Max queue depth (messages). Determines overflow risk |
| `drain-rate`      | Messages consumed per second. Caps downstream RPS    |
| `retention-hours` | Message retention duration (informational)           |
| `partitions`      | Number of partitions (informational)                 |

**How queues transform traffic:**

1. **RPS capping** — downstream receives at most `drain-rate` RPS, regardless of inbound volume
2. **Overflow** — when `inbound_rps > drain_rate`, the buffer fills:
   ```
   fill_rate        = inbound_rps − drain_rate
   time_to_overflow = buffer / fill_rate  (seconds)
   ```
3. **Latency reset** — queues break the cumulative latency chain. Downstream latency starts from queue wait time:
   ```
   wait_time_ms = (fill_rate / drain_rate) × 1000
   ```
4. **Availability decoupling** — producer and consumer sides have independent availability

> **Mutual exclusion:** `buffer` cannot be combined with `max-rps`. A component is either a queue or a service.

---

## Groups

Groups represent clusters, pods, or replica sets. Wrap components in `[Group Name]`:

```
[API Cluster]
  instances: 3
  APIServer
    max-rps: 500
    latency-ms: 45
    -> DB
```

### Group properties

| Property    | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `instances` | Multiplier on child capacity. Can be a range (e.g. `1-8`).   |
| `collapsed` | Set to `true` to start the group collapsed. See below.       |

The group's `instances` acts as a **capacity multiplier** on its children. If `APIServer` has `max-rps: 500` and the group has `instances: 3`, total capacity is `500 × 3 = 1,500 RPS`.

### No nested groups

A `[Group]` may contain components but **not other groups**. If you need a deeper hierarchy, model it with tags or split the diagram.

### Group aliases

Like nodes, groups support `as alias`:

```
[Customer Order Pods] as orders
  instances: 3
  APIServer
    -> ordersdb

LB
  -> orders                         // route to the group via alias
```

### Collapsed groups

A trailing `collapsed` flag on the group line (`[Backend] collapsed`) renders the group as a single combined node rather than the bracketed cluster. The collapsed node shows:

- The group label and instance count
- The **worst child health** (overloaded > warning > normal) as the rollup color
- A small collapse bar at the bottom of the card as a visual hint

Collapsed groups still participate in traffic simulation — only the rendering changes.

### Connecting to groups

Traffic sent to a group is distributed to its children:

```
LB
  -/api-> [API Cluster] split: 60%
```

### Bottleneck capacity

When a group contains multiple components in a chain, the group's effective capacity is the **bottleneck** — the minimum capacity among its children:

```
[Backend Pod]
  instances: 3
  API            // max-rps 500 per instance
    max-rps: 500
    -> Cache
  Cache          // max-rps 2000 per instance
    max-rps: 2000
```

Effective capacity: `500 × 3 = 1,500` (bottlenecked on API, not Cache).

### Queue scaling in groups

For queues inside groups, `drain-rate` scales with group instances (more consumers = faster draining), but `buffer` does **not** scale (fixed capacity per queue).

---

## Tags

Tags add metadata dimensions — team ownership, environment, region. They appear as colored badges in the legend.

```
tag Team as t
  Backend blue
  Platform teal default
  Data(violet)

CDN t: Platform
API t: Backend
DB t: Data
```

- `tag Name alias x` — declare a tag group with optional shorthand
- `Value color` — a tag value with its color (lowercase, trailing token)
- `default` — auto-applies to components without this tag
- `alias: Value` — assign inline on a component

---

## How Calculations Work

DGMO runs a full traffic simulation. This section explains the math so you can predict what the diagram will show.

### How RPS Propagates

Traffic flows from the edge via breadth-first traversal. At each component, behaviors transform the RPS in order:

1. **Cache:** `rps = rps × (1 − cache_hit / 100)`
2. **Firewall:** `rps = rps × (1 − firewall_block / 100)`
3. **Rate limiter:** `rps = min(rps, ratelimit_rps)`
4. **Queue:** `rps = min(rps, drain_rate × group_instances)`

Then the post-behavior RPS is split across outbound edges by their split percentages. If a node receives traffic from multiple sources, values are summed.

**Example:**

```
Edge (100K) → CDN (cache 80%) → 20K → WAF (block 5%) → 19K → LB
  LB splits: /api 60% → 11,400   /static 40% → 7,600
```

### How Latency Is Computed

Latency accumulates along the path from edge to each leaf:

- Each component adds its `latency-ms`
- Multiple incoming paths → DGMO takes the **maximum** (worst case)
- Queues **reset** the chain — downstream starts from queue wait time

**Percentiles (p50 / p90 / p99):** DGMO collects all edge-to-leaf paths, weights them by traffic volume, sorts by latency, and interpolates at the 50th/90th/99th weight thresholds.

For serverless with cold starts, each path splits into a 95% warm sub-path and a 5% cold sub-path. Cold starts therefore affect p99 more than p50.

### How Availability Is Computed

Availability has two layers:

**1. Uptime (path-based):** Product of all `uptime` values along the path from edge:

```
path_uptime = product(each component's uptime / 100)
```

Multiple paths → take the minimum (most conservative).

**2. Local availability (load-dependent):** Each component's availability based on current load:

- **Under capacity:** 1.0 (100%)
- **Overloaded:** `capacity / inbound_rps` (degrades linearly)
- **Rate-limited:** `ratelimit_rps / effective_inbound_rps`
- **Queue filling (overflow < 60s):** `drain_rate / inbound_rps`

**3. Compound:** Product of all local availabilities along the path.

Queues decouple availability — consumer-side doesn't inherit producer overload.

### How Circuit Breakers Trip

| Condition  | Check                           | Trips when                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Error rate | `(rps − capacity) / rps × 100`  | `≥ cb-error-threshold`      |
| Latency    | cumulative latency at this node | `> cb-latency-threshold-ms` |

Either condition triggers the breaker to open.

### How Queue Metrics Are Derived

| Metric           | Formula                            | Meaning                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Fill rate        | `max(0, inbound_rps − drain_rate)` | Queue growth speed (msg/s) |
| Time to overflow | `buffer / fill_rate`               | Seconds until full         |
| Wait time        | `(fill_rate / drain_rate) × 1000`  | Per-message wait (ms)      |

If `fill_rate = 0` (drain keeps up), time to overflow is infinite and wait time is 0.

---

## Validation

DGMO validates your diagram and reports diagnostics:

| Check              | What it catches                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cycle detection    | Circular connections (must be a DAG)                               |
| Split sum          | Split percentages not adding to 100%                               |
| Orphan detection   | Components not reachable from the edge                             |
| Overload           | RPS exceeding component capacity                                   |
| Rate-limit excess  | Inbound RPS exceeding the rate limiter                             |
| System uptime      | Overall uptime below 99%                                           |
| Property conflicts | Mixing incompatible properties (e.g., `concurrency` + `instances`) |

### Edge metadata

These appear after the target as same-line metadata: `-> Target split: 60%, fanout: 3`

| Metadata | Type       | Effect                                                                |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `split`  | percentage | Share of source RPS sent to this target (must sum to ≤ 100% with siblings) |
| `fanout` | number     | RPS multiplier delivered to the target (≥ 1); see [Fanout](#fanout)   |
