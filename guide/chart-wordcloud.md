## Data Format

Each data line assigns a weight to a word. Higher weights produce larger text:

```
swordsmanship 95
navigation 88
seamanship 85
```

## Body Text Mode

You can also paste raw text directly — the word cloud will count word frequencies automatically. Common stop words (a, the, is, etc.) are filtered out.

wordcloud Gettysburg Address

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth
on this continent a new nation conceived in Liberty and
dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether
that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated
can long endure.
